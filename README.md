HORUS Cyberinfrastructure 

The HORUS project combines existing large-scale scientific data storage from the previously funded NSF OSiRIS project with a broad range of computational resources to enable accelerated scientific discovery for universities, colleges and community colleges in Michigan and the surrounding regions. The project focuses on providing easy access to diverse computing and storage resources, both of which are required for scientific research and analysis. This will be especially beneficial for researchers at smaller institutions, enabling them to more effectively contribute to society by expediting their research. In addition, through its connection to OSG and the PATh project, it will serve as an on-ramp to even larger scale resources across the nation when that is needed.

The project establishes a set of compute servers to complement the existing OSIRIS storage system attached to the MERIT statewide research and education network in Michigan. The system consists of 4 GPU nodes (each with two A100 GPUs), 10 Large Memory compute nodes (each with two AMD Epyc 7F72 3.2 GHz 24 core processors) and 10 compute nodes (each with 2 AMD Epyc 7H12 2.6GHz 64 core processors). This resource and associated services provide computational services to a suite of universities including University of Michigan, Wayne State University, Oakland University, Eastern Michigan University, and Oakland Community College.
