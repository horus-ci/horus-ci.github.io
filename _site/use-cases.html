<p>The following projects have driven the development of HORUS and point to the types of use cases others may apply. A summary table also defines the computing details and requirements for each of these projects.</p>

<p><strong>Material Simulation — University of Michigan</strong>: Explores material properties by running material simulation applications using so-called integral files (typically 1-2 TB each) to do computation. With recent GPU optimization, the bottleneck for certain calculations is now completely related to the I/O efficiency, especially when one considers disorder (where hundreds of 1-2 TB files are used in each simulation). For HORUS, it will be interesting to see how these codes perform with quick read access to multiple such files in OSiRIS storage. This discipline is well matched to HORUS GPU use in parallel with the OSiRIS storage.</p>

<p><strong>Pritzker Neuropsychiatric Disorders Research Consortium</strong>: The Pritzker Consortium aims to 1) discover neurobiological and genetic causes of major depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia 2) identify biomarkers for better diagnosis and novel targets for their treatment. The Consortium involves researchers from several institutions including Cornell, Stanford, UC Irvine, HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, and the University of Michigan. This area of work has significant computational and data challenges.</p>

<p><strong>Van Andel Institute</strong>: Van Andel Institute hosts a busy genomics facility that is used heavily both internally and by neighboring regional collaborators in West Michigan (such as Michigan State University). Last year nearly $1 million of mainly genomics services was provided to external partners (mainly MSU). This effort represents dozens to hundreds of TBs of unique data to be analyzed and transformed, which is a challenge to move and even harder to analyze. The analyses required are each a special challenge, requiring a mix of central VAI computation mixed with those of the individual customers (researchers).</p>

<p><strong>Cryo-EM</strong> — University of Michigan: Single particle cryo-electron microscopy allows scientists to determine the atomic structure of biological macromolecules. Given that the 3D structure of a protein determines its function, understanding the structure of proteins allows structural biologists to understand basic biology, evolution, human health, and disease. At UM, computing and storage is a huge bottleneck for cryo-EM researchers on campus. Currently, each lab that uses cryo-EM instruments needs to accommodate their own storage and computing, which means each lab has local workstations. A centralized compute-resource and data storage would be a boon for the campus. Existing solutions are not optimal for a large number of users. On campus, more than 30 laboratories are using the UM Cryo-EM resource.</p>

<p><strong>Evolutionary Genomics</strong> — Oakland University: This discipline explores deep evolutionary histories (e.g., early life evolution) which require large-scale simulations and analyses of empirical data. These kinds of analyses use Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian approaches that require extensive computational time, even in a parallelized environment. Additionally, the reconstruction of ancient phylogenetic events are highly dependent on assumptions and priors given at the start of the analyses. Extensive hypothesis-testing to determine the robustness of results to these assumptions is required. Additional centralized computational resources and data storage are key to continue this line of research at Oakland University and to grow its reach over time (e.g., ancestral state reconstructions).</p>

<p><strong>Network Telescope — Merit</strong>: Network telescopes, or darknets, consist of networking instrumentation that receive and record unsolicited internet traffic destined to large swaths of unused IP space. Internet traffic destined to this “dark IP space” is inherently suspicious since no real user services are hosted in the IP space monitored by the darknet. Thus, darknets provide a unique vantage point to computer networking and cybersecurity researchers for studying internet-wide scanning activities, distributed denial of service attacks, misconfigurations, and even network outages. Merit operates one of only two large network telescopes in the country and maintains an archive of darknet data dating back to 2005. Currently, Merit’s darknet collects more than 100 GB of compressed PCAP data daily, and the archive exceeds 500 TB. Processing the telescope data is challenging because of the large amounts of CPU, memory, and storage required. Tasks include: 1) longitudinal studies, 2) performing annotations with external, third-party data sources (e.g., Censys.io, historical DNS data, etc.), and 3) employing ML/AI/statistical techniques for data clustering, predictive analytics, inference, anomaly detection, and other applications.</p>

<p><strong>Population Health Informatics — Oakland University</strong>: This discipline involves multiple research projects using natural language processing and machine learning for biomedical and healthcare analytics. Heterogeneous datasets include massive amounts of unstructured textual data as well as alphanumeric tabular data and image data. Natural language processing is GPU-intensive; currently, the relatively few number of GPU nodes result in extended wait times for jobs in the queue to start running.</p>

<p><strong>Oakland Genomics Oleksyk Lab — Oakland University</strong>: Genomic analysis on a population scale often operates with extensive volumes of data and requires multi-step heterogenous (cpu/IO intensive) analysis. For example, a basic population genomics dataset of 100 samples amounts to an estimated 9 TB of data and 60 billions of short unassembled reads. During the initial steps of this analysis (sequence alignment and variant calling) the total dataset temporarily triples in volume. In addition to the approaches to optimize the later downstream analysis, some of the approaches in the field (i.e. population structure using dense sequencing data analysis) involve model-based Bayesian clustering and similar computationally intensive data. The requirements for storage, IO, and CPU increases and expands with every additional step used for comparative analyses of multiple populations that involve thousands of samples. Additional data storage and storage-lenient computational resources would allow Oakland University and our laboratory to stay current with the demands of big data analysis, enable use of the latest computational instruments, and further promote research and collaboration with other groups in the field.</p>

<p><strong>Autophagic Body Modeling — Eastern Michigan University</strong>: Autophagic body modeling is an important tool for improving our basic understanding of the process of autophagy, a conserved intracellular recycling pathway important for human health. We measure the size and number of autophagic bodies formed in yeast with altered levels of key autophagy proteins. Accurate estimation of the original size and number of autophagic bodies from random TEM sections requires the use of a simulation to compare with the actual data. We are developing improved versions of this simulation that use CompuCell3D (CC3D) to model the bodies as more realistic non-spherical shapes. Currently, a single CC3D run takes ~1 hour on a laptop, but our automated workflow will require thousands of runs to generate enough simulated data for statistical accuracy.</p>

<p><strong>JETSCAPE — Wayne State University</strong>: The JETSCAPE collaboration (jetscape.org) is a consortium of about 50 researchers from 14 institutions in the US, Canada, Japan, and Germany, including physicists, computer scientists, and statisticians. The collaboration develops simulation frameworks for the simulation of very high energy nuclear collisions. These collisions carried out at the Brookhaven National Lab. and at CERN produce nuclear-sized exploding droplets of matter that reach temperatures over 3 trillion degrees Celsius. The software is made available to the worldwide community via Github. However, these simulations are extremely compute-intensive. From time to time, the collaboration will compete for and receive computing allocations to carry out large-scale simulations and compare with experimental data. However, the typical allocations fall far short of the required time; hence, the collaboration has divided the simulation into several stages which can be simulated separately. The results of the earlier stages are then stored in large storage facilities such as OSiRIS where they can be retrieved to carry out the later stages of the simulations. HORUS will provide needed resources for the collaboration as well as a mechanism for broader access to the models and datasets.</p>

<p><strong>Heavy-Element Quantum Chemistry — Oakland University</strong>: Successful heavy-element chemistry depends on the availability of powerful tools of theoretical chemistry to predict the non-trivial behavior of the elements at the bottom of the periodic table. The development of reliable infrastructure (basis sets, force fields, density functionals) for predictive relativistic quantum-chemical modeling of complex chemical systems — involving actinides, heavy main-group, and superheavy elements — relies on a readily accessible computing facility with hundreds of CPUs, including large-memory nodes, and massive and fast scratch space. The continuation of this line of research at Oakland University is predicated on sustainable maintenance and growth beyond the current high-performance computing cluster in the wake of an influx of new STEM faculty with growing demands for expansive parallel computing.</p>

<p><strong>Certificate Program in Data Science — Oakland Community College</strong>: The Data Science Certificate is designed to provide a strong foundation for data investigation, including data wrangling, cleaning, security, regression and classification, prediction, and data communication. It will be a 35-hour program including Python, R programming for data science, machine learning, big data, and NoSQL. OCC needs easy-to-use compute, storage, and software resources to provide a broad introduction to the exploding field of data science.</p>
