HORUS currently has 14 compute nodes deployed at our three institution sites: University of Michigan, Wayne State University and Michigan State University. Each node of those is configured with either a large number of CPUs (LC), a large amount of memory (LM), or four NVIDIA A100 GPU cards to meet the computational needs of our users. The following picture shows the deployed systems with labels identifying the type and site of each one.
