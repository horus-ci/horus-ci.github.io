Welcome to the HORUS!  To finish enrollment there are a couple more steps.  

<h2>Confirm your email</h2>

<p>  Please check your email.  Your enrollment cannot be completed until you have confirmed your email by clicking the link in the email.  You may also copy/paste the link into your browser.   The email subject is "Invitation to join HORUS/OSiRIS".  
</p>

<img style="width: 100%" src="{{IMAGE_PATH}}/documentation/enrollment/confirmationEmail.png" alt="COmanage confirmation email"/>

<h2>Already confirmed your email?</h2>

<p>Someone from HORUS or your virtual organization will need to confirm your enrollment.  When it is confirmed you will receive a 2nd email with subject "Petition to join HORUS/OSiRIS has been approved".  Once you have this email you can proceed to <a href="https://comanage.osris.org/registry/auth/login">login to comanage</a> if necessary.  Some HORUS use cases do not require any further interaction with COmanage beyond the enrollment, but others may require you to use it to retrieve or upload credentials.  </p>

<p>
Please have a look at our <a href="http://www.horus-ci.org/documentation/">documentation</a> to get started.  
</p>

<h2>Have not enrolled yet?</h2>
<p>If you've ended up at this page but have not initiated enrollment in HORUS please have a look at our <a href="http://www.horus-ci.org/documentation/enrollment.html">enrollment instructions</a>.  They will provide some background on what OSiRIS is and point you to the enrollment gateway.
