HORUS is currently accepting pilot users [point to form fill]

<!-- no form, what action to take? -->

As part of science domain on-boarding, we create a new COU (Collaborative Organization Unit) to provide access to researchers in their respective areas. New users will be directed to a self-service web interface that will let them request membership in that new COU. It must then be approved by the designated representative(s) of that domain. Once users are accepted into the COU, they can use their institutional identity to use HORUS and OSiRIS services (data transfers, batch scheduling, task monitoring, etc).
